## Key Flows

### Email OTP Verification
1. After registration, the user is redirected to the verification page.
2. A 6-digit OTP is sent to the user's email.
3. Upon successful verification, the account is activated and the user is logged in.

### Password Protected Links
1. If a user tries to access a shortened URL that is password protected:
2. The backend redirects them to the frontend's `/p/:shortCode` page.
3. The user enters the password, and upon success, they are redirected to the target URL.

### Link Expiration
1. Users can set an expiration date when shortening a URL.
2. If the current date is past the expiration, the link will automatically resolve to a "Link Expired" error page.

## Getting Started

1.  **Navigate to the frontend directory**: `cd frontend`
2.  **Install dependencies**: `pnpm install`
3.  **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file with:
    ```
    VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
    ```
4.  **Run Development Server**: `pnpm run dev`

## Vercel Deployment

1. Import the `frontend` folder into a new Vercel project.
2. The `vercel.json` file handles single-page application (SPA) routing, automatically preventing 404 errors on refresh.
3. Add the following Environment Variable:
   - `VITE_BACKEND_URL`: The URL of your deployed backend.
